# A Garry's Mod Client Side RTS Game.
This is a lua cheat that communicates to other alt accounts on the same server and allows you to control your alt accounts in a rts.

The code needs a webserver to run because I couldn't find a solution to sending information to client to client.

How I ran multiple accounts at the same time is using a program called Sandboxie but you can use virtual box. The accounts
have to be bought accounts because you cant run mutliple gmod accounts at the same time via family share.
