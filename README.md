# A Garry's Mod Client Side RTS Game.
This is a lua cheat that communicates to other alt accounts on the same server and allows you to control your alt accounts in a rts.

The code needs a webserver to run because I couldn't find a solution to sending information to client to client, to run a web server
you will need a program called xampp or any other program that can run a webserver like apache. 

How I ran multiple accounts at the same time is using a program called Sandboxie but you can use virtual box. The accounts
have to be bought accounts because you cant run mutliple gmod accounts at the same time via family share.

This counts as a cheat because you need to inject it onto a server via GLua Loader or some other injector and you would need to do
this on all of the accounts you have on the server.
